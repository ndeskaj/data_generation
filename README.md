# Synthetic data generation using Generative AI

Synthetic data is artificially generated to mimic real-world data. We will use a dataset, which contains daily records of insights into app usage patterns over time. We will use this dataset and feed into a Generative Adversarial Netweork (GAN) model, which will be trained to generate new data samples that will be similar to the original data and the relationships between the features of the original data.
